<h2>Step 1: Reflection</h2>

<h3>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h3>
<p>I started out by looking at Josh Cochran's site and other very clean, simple illustrator portfolios.</p>

<h3>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h3>
<p>I like that it can scale for mobile--and have enjoyed finally learning how media queries work to trigger the responsive elements. I like getting away from a table-based design and really simplifying my code. I also love having the ability to integrate nicer fonts through google fonts --and now being able to add my own custom fonts. I love being able to remove as much design from the HTML and keep almost all of that in the CSS--I want to use as few images on the site as possible (beyond the content itself.)

<h3>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h3>
<p>On all of the sites I worked on for this class (my own portfolio, my friends, and the partner project) I sort of figured out how I wanted the sites to work mid-coding, and would have to back-track and let the simplicity of the code help define how to the site should work. When it was getting too complicated, it usually meant I was putting too many variables into the mix.</p>

<h3>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</h3>
<p>I had a lot of trouble understanding WHERE to put the code, and sometime would add the same instructions to multiple tags just to cover my bases. I knew it was wrong, and thankfully mentor John called me out on that and helped walk me through the right places to put the code in the tags.</p>

<h3>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h3>
<p>I learned that it is much easier to view a portfolio and click buttons on a site that has been optimized for mobile, rather than just shrunk down to fit a phone screen.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Reviews</h2>
<h3>Group 1</h3>
<h4>http://www.businessoffashion.com/</h4>
<h3>layout</h3>
<p>Nicely organized grid, taking a lot of information and putting it in a pretty clear hierarchy.
The sidebar ads look just as bad as they do on every other site and banner ad in the middle is floating around with tons of odd whitespace, so it that way it still looks like most other news sites.</p>

<h3>typography</h3>
<p>Pretty clean an simple. A nice marriage of serious "business" with a couple of serifs to lend it a little "fashion". The blackletter "0" in the logo already feels dated, but i like how they swap that character out for other elements (like buttons) in other places on the site.</p>

<h3>navigation</h3>
<p>The clean simple gray nav bar doesn't overpower the content, and functions well as you scroll under it. There are lots of mini-navigational elements throughout the site, which is a little overwhelming at first glance, but in use, they are fairly intuitive (like the “companies” bar on the careers page)</p>

<h3>overall flow</h3>
<p>Each channel of the site uses the same grid, but they may do a two column system on one channel homepage or keep the sidebar, or make it one big chart. The story they are telling in each section drives the layout. I think by keeping the type and colors simply they can get away with it and not confuse the reader. </p>


<H3>Group 2</h3>
<h4>Space Jam</h4>
<p>We'll look back on everything we're doing now and think it's terrible and dated too. I think the only real problem with the SpaceJam site given the time it was created is that they downplayed Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters. </p>
